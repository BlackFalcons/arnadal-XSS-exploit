# Arnadal XSS exploit
This exploit does no longer work as the site with the exploit upgraded their CMS.

If you would like to test the POC [check out Web Archive's copy of the site before the upgrade.](http://web.archive.org/web/20200804232909/https://www.arnadal.no/)

The commit history is bad because github cache the data from files, but a bypass for that is to update the file name.
